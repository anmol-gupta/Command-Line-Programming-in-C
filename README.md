# Command-Line-Programming-in-C

Programs for C using command line arguments.

### What are Command Line Arguments?

Many programs allow command-line arguments to be specified when they are run. A command-line argument is the information that follows the program's name on the command line of the operating system. Command-line arguments are used to pass information to the program.

### How to pass Command Line Argument?

In terminal, type gcc and after that the file you want to compile. For Example - gcc <filename>.
  
Now an executable file will be generated namely a.out by default. Again comeback to terminal, and type ./a.out and the next thing you will be watching in terminal will be the program you typed in action.
